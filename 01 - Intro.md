Boring stuff

In recent years, everything uses deep learning
(neural networks).

## Exam

Students will be assesses with an oral exam
- The oral exam will consist of three questions
  about theory
- Unwritten rule: if the answer is "I don't
  remember", she does not ask any other question
  and you get obliterated and sent to the
  backrooms
- The exam can be done online only if the student
  really cannot be present

## Prerequisites

- basic computer science algorithms, linear
  algebra

## Books

- The bible: C. Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, SPringer 2006
- I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, A. Courville, Deep Learning, MIT Press, 2016

Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve
automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of artificial
intelligence.
- Knowledge is achquired through **algorithms** by learning and
  inferring from **data**.
- Knowledge is represented by a **model**.

Triplet <T, P, E>

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that:
- improve their performance P
- on some task T
- with experience E

**Artificial Intelligence** ->
	Programs with the ability to learn and reason like humans
  **Machine Learning** ->
	Algorithms with the ability to learn without being explicitly
	programmed
	**Deep Learning** ->
		Subset of machine learning in which artificial neural
		networks adapt and learn from vast amounts of data
